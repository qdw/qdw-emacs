Quinn's ~/.emacs.d
------------------
Requires you to have a ~/.emacs that reads
    (load-file "~/.emacs.d/.emacs")

Tested on
- emacs 24.2.1 on OS X 10.7
    - Cocoa mode
    - character-based mode
- emacs 23.1.1 on Scientific Linux 6.1
    - character-based mode only
    
Eventually I should make this a sub-repo of my dotfiles repo.
