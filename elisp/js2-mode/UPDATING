First:
  svn up http://js2-mode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/js2-mode-read-only

Then:
Byte-compile the file by doing the following, in a lisp-interaction-mode
buffer such as *scratch* (since you can't run Aquamacs in batch-mode AFAICT):
  (load-file
    (expand-file-name
      "~/.emacs.d/elisp/js2-mode/js2-mode-read-only/js2-build.el"))

  (js2-build-js2-mode)
