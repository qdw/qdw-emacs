NAME
    yaml-mode - A Simple mode for editing files in the YAML data serialization format

VERSION
    0.0.2

SYNOPSIS
    To install, just drop this file into a directory in your
    `load-path' and (optionally) byte-compile it or see INSTALL section.
    To automatically handle files ending in '.yml', add something like:

    (require 'yaml-mode)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.yml$" . yaml-mode))

    to your .emacs file.

    Unlike python-mode, this mode follows the Emacs convention of not
    binding the ENTER key to `newline-and-indent'.  To get this
    behavior, add the key definition to `yaml-mode-hook':

    (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
      '(lambda ()
        (define-key yaml-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)))

DESCRIPTION
    This is a major mode for editing files in the YAML data serialization format.
    It was initially developed by Yoshiki Kurihara and many features were added by
    Marshall Vandegrift. As YAML and Python share the fact that indentation determines
    structure, this mode provides indentation and indentation command behavior
    very similar to that of python-mode.

INSTALL
    You can install yaml-mode typing below.

        % make
        % make install

        or

        % make PREFIX=/your/home/dir
        % make install PREFIX=/your/home/dir

SETTING
    see SYNOPSIS.
